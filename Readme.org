* undo-propose

~undo-propose.el~ is a package that allows you to stage undo's in a
temporary buffer before committing them.

Emacs' undo system is powerful, but difficult to navigate, due to the
fact that Emacs treats previous undo's as ordinary changes that can
themselves be undone. One can get lost when moving through a chain of
undo's, undo's of undo's, and so forth, as the same edit will be
traversed multiple times backwards and forwards.  On top of that,
trying to find an old edit can add many undo's to the edit history,
making the undo ring longer and more difficult to navigate later on.

~undo-propose~ addresses this by letting you stage undo's inside a
temporary buffer.  This has a few benefits:
1. If you get lost, you can cancel the whole series of undo's, without
   modifying the original buffer or undo history.
2. You can search through your undo history for old snippets, copy and
   paste them back in manually, then discard the rest of the undo's.
3. When finished undo'ing, you can choose to squash the undo's and add
   them as a single edit event. This makes the undo history shorter;
   to go back, you only have to undo 1 step, rather than redo'ing each
   undo individually.

** Installation

~undo-propose~ is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]].

** Usage

To use undo-propose, call ~M-x undo-propose~ in the buffer you are
editing.  This will send you to a new temporary buffer, which is
read-only except for allowing ~undo~ commands.  In this buffer, call
~undo~ as you normally would, until you have reached your desired
place in the undo history.  When you are finished, type ~C-c C-c~ to
commit the changes (both in the buffer and undo-ring) back to the
parent. Alternatively, type ~C-c C-s~ to copy the buffer but not the
individual undo events (squashing them into a single edit event in the
undo history). To cancel, type ~C-c C-k~.  You can also ediff the
proposed chain of undo's by typing ~C-c C-d~.

** Example configurations
*** Simple configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'undo-propose)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c u") 'undo-propose)
#+end_src

*** Opinionated evil configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'evil
    (global-undo-tree-mode -1)
    (evil-define-key 'normal 'global "u" 'undo-only))

  (use-package undo-propose
    :commands undo-propose
    :init
    (evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "C-r") 'undo-propose))
#+end_src

Note that ~undo-propose~ (~C-r~ in this configuration) acts as normal
~undo~ when already in an ~undo-propose-mode~ buffer.

** Adding commands (e.g. redo)

The ~undo-propose~ buffer is read-only, so most commands won't work.
However, ~undo~ and ~undo-only~ are specially wrapped so that they
will work in the buffer.  You can use the macro ~undo-propose-wrap~ to
make additional commands useable in ~undo-propose~.  For example, to
add [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RedoMode][redo]], call ~(undo-propose-wrap redo)~.

** Related packages

undo-propose is inspired by [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UndoTree][undo-tree]] and [[https://melpa.org/#/git-timemachine][git-timemachine]].

See [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UndoTree][undo-tree]] for a more powerful undo navigation
system. Unfortunately, many users experience corruption issues,
leading to lost work (for example, see
[[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1074]] and
[[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_best_redo_mode.html]]).

In contrast, undo-propose is much smaller, and meant to complement
native emacs' undo rather than replace it. It tries to minimize direct
interaction with undo internals, in order to reduce the likelihood of
bugs that corrupt the undo history.

** Changes
*** 3.0.0

~undo-propose-commit-buffer-only~ was renamed to
~undo-propose-squash-commit~, and its keybinding ~C-c C-b~ was moved
to ~C-c C-s~

*** 2.0.0

~C-c C-c~ in the undo-propose buffer now commits to the undo-history
(~undo-propose-commit~).  To copy the buffer but not the undo-history
(squashing the undo's), use ~C-c C-b~
(~undo-propose-commit-buffer-only~).  The old function
~undo-propose-finish~ is now obsolete; use
~undo-propose-commit-buffer-only~ instead.
