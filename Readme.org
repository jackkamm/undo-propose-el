* undo-propose

~undo-propose.el~ is a package for navigating through your undo history
in a temporary buffer.

Emacs treats previous undo's as ordinary changes that can themselves be undone,
making it possible to revisit any point in your edit history.
However, it's easy to get turned around when moving through a chain of undo's, undo's of undo's,
and so forth, as the same edit will be traversed multiple times backwards and forwards.
On top of that, trying to find an old edit may add many undo's to the edit history,
making the undo ring longer and more difficult to navigate later on.

undo-propose addresses this by letting you undo inside a temporary buffer.
This has 2 benefits:
1. If you get lost, you can cancel the whole series of undo's, without modifying the original buffer or undo history.
2. The series of undo's gets added as a single edit event, which makes the undo history simpler; you don't have to individually redo each undo later on.

To use undo-propose, call "M-x undo-propose" in the buffer you are editing.
This will send you to a new temporary buffer, which is read-only except
for allowing `undo' commands.  Cycle through the list of undo's as normal.
When you are finished, type "C-c C-c" to add the chain of undo's as a
single edit to the undo history.  To cancel, type "C-c C-k".  You can also
ediff the proposed chain of undo's by typing "C-c C-d".

** Screenshot

In the following gif, I enter some text, call ~undo-propose~, do a sequence of undo's and redo's within the ~undo-propose~ buffer, compare against the original buffer with ~ediff~, commit the sequence of undo's, and finally undo (redo) the change made by ~undo-propose~.

** Other notes

See [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UndoTree][undo-tree.el]] for a more powerful undo navigation system. Unfortunately,
many users experience occasional corruption issues, leading to lost work
(for example, see [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1074]]).

In contrast, undo-propose is meant
to complement native emacs' undo, rather than replace it,
and has an extremely simple implementation.
It aims to improve the useability of emacs' undo,
while avoiding the corruption issues that sometimes affect more ambitious [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_best_redo_mode.html][attempts]].
