;;; Commentary:

;; redo+.el is bug fix and extended version of XEmacs' redo package.

;; Emacs' normal undo system allows you to undo an arbitrary
;; number of buffer changes.  These undos are recorded as ordinary
;; buffer changes themselves.  So when you break the chain of
;; undos by issuing some other command, you can then undo all
;; the undos.  The chain of recorded buffer modifications
;; therefore grows without bound, truncated only at garbage
;; collection time.
;;
;; The redo/undo system is different in two ways:
;;   1. The undo/redo command chain is only broken by a buffer
;;      modification.  You can move around the buffer or switch
;;      buffers and still come back and do more undos or redos.
;;   2. The `redo' command rescinds the most recent undo without
;;      recording the change as a _new_ buffer change.  It
;;      completely reverses the effect of the undo, which
;;      includes making the chain of buffer modification records
;;      shorter by one, to counteract the effect of the undo
;;      command making the record list longer by one.

;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Save this file as redo+.el, byte compile it and put the
;; resulting redo.elc file in a directory that is listed in
;; load-path.
;;
;; In your .emacs file, add
;;   (require 'redo+)
;; and the system will be enabled.
;;
;; In addition, if you don't want to redo a previous undo, add
;;   (setq undo-no-redo t)
;; You can also use a function `undo-only' instead of `undo'
;; in GNU Emacs 22 or later.
